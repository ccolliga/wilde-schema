File name format


the title of the report should be standardised to this format exactly (pay attention to spacing and punctuation)
eg.   The Australian Star - May 22 1895.xml
when there is more than one report on a particular day, use this format exactly
	eg.   The Australian Star - May 22 1895.a.xml
	eg.   The Australian Star - May 22 1895.b.xml
Don’t use parentheses or apostrophes in title names. Instead, use this format exactly:
eg.   Reynolds_s Newspaper - June 22 1895.b.xml

	NB. Keep the “the” article only if the newspaper has the “the” in its title.
