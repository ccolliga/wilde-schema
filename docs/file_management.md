# File Management

## Folder Structure

The Wilde Trials International News Archive uses the following foldering structure for its news report files: Region > Newspaper Title > News Report. 

* Region folders are labelled by country: eg. Britain, France, Jamaica, etc...

* Region folders contain sub-folders with Newspaper Titles published within the region. 

* Newspaper Title sub-folders contain files for individual Wilde news reports. Make sure to preserve the article “the” when it is part of the newspaper title.

## File Names

Create a unique xml file for each individual news reports. The name of the news report should follow this format: 

* The Australian Star - May 22 1895.xml

When there is more than one report on a particular day, use this format:

* The Australian Star - May 22 1895.a.xml
* The Australian Star - May 22 1895.b.xml

Do not use parentheses or apostrophes in file names. Instead, use this format:

* Reynolds_s Newspaper - June 22 1895.b.xml
