# File Management


## Folder Structure

The Wilde Trials International News Archive uses the following nested foldering structure for its text files: 

- **Region**: Region folders are labelled by country: eg. France, Jamaica, etc...
  - **Newspaper**: Newspaper sub-folders are labelled by newspaper title. 
    - **News Reports**: News Reports are the individual Wilde news reports files.
   
## File Names

A unique file is created for each individual news report. The name of the news report should follow this format, making sure to preserve the article (“the”) when it is part of the newspaper title. 

* The Australian Star - May 22 1895.xml

When there is more than one report on a particular day, use this format:

* The Australian Star - May 22 1895.a.xml
* The Australian Star - May 22 1895.b.xml

Do not use parentheses or apostrophes in file names. Instead, use this format:

* Reynolds_s Newspaper - June 22 1895.b.xml
