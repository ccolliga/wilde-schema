# Getting Started

## Setting up

Before working on the Wilde Reports, there are two pieces of software you will need to install: oXygen XML Editor and Github Desktop. You will also need a Github account.

* Provide the DHIL with your GitHub account username. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can create a free account here: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
* Download and install oXygen:[https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/download_oxygenxml_editor.html](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/download_oxygenxml_editor.html) Members of the team should contact the DHIL for a license key.
* Download and install the GitHub desktop client: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Getting a copy of the reports

* Create a fork of the Wilde Reports repository.
* Use GitHub Desktop to clone your fork of the repository to your computer.

## Setting up oXygen

* Open oXygen
* If this is your first time opening oXygen, you can close most of the panes on the right-hand and bottom side of your editor window. Make sure, however, that you retain the Project pane.
* In the toolbar, click `Project/Open Project` and navigate to the `wilde-reports` directory.
* Open the `reports.xpr` file and accept the popup notification from oXygen.
