1. COLLECTION OF REPORTS

Overview
Newspapers around the world grouped together news articles differently; and digitisation/ocr have also made different choices about article segmentation. Together, these factors raise a big question: what is a news article? The Archive has developed some criteria for determining what constitutes an individual news report and, thus, gets included in one file. When in doubt, ask Colette.

Search protocols
Within a database, search for articles on the Wilde trials and aftermath from April 1 1895 to Dec 31 1895.
Use these search terms: “Oscar Wilde.” Then try “Wilde”;  then “Queensberry” to see if they catch more results, and “Lord Alfred Douglas”
Collect all relevant articles from one newspaper at a time. The goal is to get complete runs of coverage over the selected period.

Collection protocols
To determine what constitutes an article, prioritise evidence from the newspaper over the database’s article segmentation. In other words, does the newspaper represent it as an individual article? (eg. Does it have a headline; is it separated from other articles?). In most cases, it should be easy to figure out what is an individual news article.
If there are a few different news articles published on the same day which appear in different parts of the newspaper, each of these news articles is considered an individual news article and gets its own file. [See file naming protocols below].
In cases where there is one column, many Wilde articles, some judgement call will be needed. In most cases, this should likely be treated as one news article. The newspaper seems to have wanted the reader to read all this material together. The divisions between the news articles are probably single horizontal lines rather than new headlines.
In cases where there are two articles that appear one after the other, some judgement call will be needed.  Consider the two items as separate articles if a new big headline separates them. If in doubt, make a note and ask Colette.
In cases where there is one column, and many different articles, with Wilde text mixed in, you should just select the text that has Wilde content. Only use [...] to indicate if there is text that you have not excerpted in the middle of the selected news report. We are NO LONGER using [...] at beginning and/or ending of the article to show skipped text.
For headlines, make sure to include the title of the column as well as the title of the article. Preserve line breaks for sub-headlines. See examples of transcribed articles.

Sometimes, there will be a minor reference to Wilde, but it is not really a news item directly related to the trials and his imprisonment. In this case, you will not create an xml file, but instead make a note of the article in this excel sheet, which is called the Related Articles Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qCBiV5zki2VBvC78EDnkQ1ygvX7hahPuoKTxxlLARDM/edit?usp=sharing
What I don’t want to collect and transcribe: (eg. a Wilde type person has been arrested somewhere; there is brief mention of one of his plays; there is mention of the larger Douglas family).  This goes in Related sheet.
What I want to collect & transcribe: I do want to collect articles that report or comment at some length about trial-related matters: eg. the duels that are fought; letters from the public; accounts of Lord Alfred Douglas’s activities (as he is very closely connected to the trials); reviews of Wilde’s works, if they refer to the trials (nb. The American reviews of his plays often don’t connect to the trials, so just note that in the related sheet, rather than transcribe them)
